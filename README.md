# SharpAgent
SharpAgent is a C# AI Agent application that uses WebAPI endpoint to trigger the agent workflows.

## Overview
I a currently working on this application in my spare time. The plan isto create several services include vector databases, document processing, and AI services to name a few. These services will become steps in vasious workflows. Some could be Agent-like while other may not have any AI involvement. Initially these workflow will be triggered by calling endpoints.

## Clean Architecture
This application uses an implementation of Clean Architecture I put together from several tutorials and experience with what we currently use at my employer.
